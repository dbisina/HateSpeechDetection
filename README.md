# HateSpeechDetection
Hate Speech Detection with python


What is Hate Speech detection?
Hate speech detection is the model which identifies and detects the hateful and offensive speech being poured on the internet. Social media is a place for many people to make hateful and offensive comments about others. So hate speech detection has become an important solution to problems in today’s online world.

As we understood the main goal to build this project, let’s start with building the Hate Speech detection project in python.

Steps in building Hate Speech detection using Machine Learning
Before moving into the implementation part directly, let us get an insight into the steps in building a Hate Speech detection project with Python.
